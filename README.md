# DiceEngine
A program for handing virtual dice rolling

Currently the following dice types are available:

True Random
Every dice roll is truly random.

Competitive
Every possible result must appear at least once.

Additional Options
Guaranteed Crits
Can be enabled for d20's of any dice type except Competitive, as it already implements this feature. If you roll 19 times with a d20 dice without getting a 20, your 20th roll is guaranteed to be a 20.
